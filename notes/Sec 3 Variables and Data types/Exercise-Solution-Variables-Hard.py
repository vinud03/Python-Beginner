# phone$number = 12345 violates Rule #4 of using a special character other than an underscore as a part of the variable name
# It can be corrected as follows:
phone_number = 12345
print(phone_number)

# 123Name violates Rule #1 of a variable name not beginning with an alphabet or an underscore. 
# It can be corrected as follows:
name123 = "Benny"
print(name123)

# Output => 12345
#           Benny
