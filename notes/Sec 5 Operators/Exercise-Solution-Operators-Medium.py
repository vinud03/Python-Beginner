print(2 + 3 * 4)
# Output => 14

# If you had obtained the result of 24 while solving it manually, you need to know the order of operators while solving an equation.
# BODMAS order of operations is used in Mathematics while solving an equation where brackets such as '(...)' are solved first,
# followed by orders such as root and square of numbers, followed by division operation, then the multiplication followed by addition
# and finally subtraction
#
# If you wanted the output of the equation to be 24, you need to re-order the equation as follows:
# (2+3) * 4 which would solve the equation 2 + 3 within the bracket
# and then multiply it with 4 and thus returning the result of 24
